#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Usage: next-version.sh MODULE
#
# Prints the tag for MODULE's next release (MODULE/vX.Y.Z), or "skip" when
# there is nothing to release. Diagnostics go to stderr so stdout stays
# machine-readable.
#
# Each module is versioned on its own: its tags are MODULE/v*, and only
# commits that touch MODULE/ count towards its release, so a trailer on a
# commit that only changes another module does not move this one. A squash
# merge is a single commit, though, so a pull request's markers apply to
# every module it touches. A module is released only by a push that changes
# it; changes a push carries without touching the module wait for its next
# change rather than publishing a version nothing asked for.
#
# The release level comes from every such commit since the module's last
# release tag, so it does not depend on whether a pull request was squashed,
# merged or rebased.
#
# "Release-As: skip" is the exception: it is read only from what the push
# introduced, because skipping creates no tag and a skip read from the whole
# range would still be in the range next time, disabling releases for good.
# That covers a squash and a merge commit; a rebase that leaves the trailer on
# a commit below the tip releases normally and says so. See
# next-version_test.sh for the behaviour this must keep.
